I'm a second year master student from [Software Engineering Institute](http://www.sei.ecnu.edu.cn/), [East China Normal University](https://www.ecnu.edu.cn/). My research interest includes graph theory.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Xuemin Lin](https://tclab.ecnu.edu.cn/80/a3/c33343a360611/page.htm) and [Prof. PengCheng](https://faculty.ecnu.edu.cn/_s43/cp2_11449/main.psp)
